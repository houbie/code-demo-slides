## tslab Kernel
These slides use the [tslab](https://github.com/yunabe/tslab) kernels.

The _tslab_ npm package provides both a TypeScript and JavaScript kernel. 

The [SoS kernel](https://github.com/vatlab/SOS) is optional and only needed if you want to execute both
TypeScript and JavaScript in one notebook. Without _SoS_, you would need to switch the kernel in between executions.
